Conway's Game of Life

Files Contained:
	gameboard.cpp  - Gameboard class
	gameboard.h
	golutilities.cpp - file reading utilities
	golutilities.h
	Makefile
	README - This file
	showgen.cpp - single gen printer
	sim-gui/.cpp - attempt at GUI
	sim-tui.cpp - NCURSES based TUI
	test.aut - a test file


To build everything:
	make 

To clean up
	make clean

To package 
	make package


Working:
	- showgen
	- sim-tui
		- might have a bug with a few steps
	- Some of the alt rules
	- Part of sim-gui
	- Makefile 
		

Not working:
	-sim-gui (50%)
	-anything else
	-To view the (broken) output of the other rules, you have to uncomment a few lines in gameboard.cpp


Final Remarks:
	- This was the worst choice of a class in the last semester. Guess I'll see you in the fall.
